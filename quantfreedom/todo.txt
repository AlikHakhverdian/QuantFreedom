******** do next *******
take out price from order creation and put it as a var in process order
Selling doesn't work ... need to fix all of it by looking at buy func

********* Super important *********
- store original stop loss average entry and then you would know how much is at risk ... then from that average entry you can
calulate risk amount for generating proper size of position

if there is a sl then you calculate the possible loss without fees from abs(size * (avg entry - sl_price) / avg entry)
then you do the pnl fomula to find the size needed to get that exact loss, then if there is a tp with sl
you take the possible loss and factor that into the formula to find the tp price

if there is no sl but a tp then 197 in buy func

if there is no sl or tp or tsl then the size is just the size

Important:
- make it so leverage goes to 100 when sl or tsl moves past entry
- figure out a way to delete all cache and store cache in one place (https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/reference/envvars.html#envvar-NUMBA_CACHE_DIR)
- check calculations for cash used and cash borrowed for account
- make it so that you can have a sl infront of your avg entry
- make a tp sl order checker
- check if njit cache=True should be cache or not cache

Just a list:
- figure out how to check if sl tp tsl is infront of current open position
- add in risk amount
- Check the raise returns and make sure they are things that need to break the code and not just something that
can be passed up but the loop should be able to continue
- fix all the variable and put them all in a order ... same in the enums
- allow user to put in their own tp price sl price tsl price
- clean up all sl tp tsl pct ... check for if np.isnan and sl tp tsl prices > 0 and not np.finite
- make sure if selecting percent of account or risk percent that you have to have a size pct


TODO
1. finish risk amount and risk percent of account ... i think i would have to do that in order_nb
2. make sure size_type is in order process order execute order and long and short and also in order result

- figure out how to make order result have tp optional
- make sure you factor in fee to take profit and stop losses
- how should the take profit RR be caluclated of init stop loss or init trailing stop?
- risk specific amount of account and make sure it is based on start balance or freecash > starting balance
- risk % of account with fee taken into consideration
- make there be a difference between account increase pnl and trade pnl for
- check to make sure that when you do np.inf it is grabing the position size and not adding any leverage too it ... close it out properly

if not moved sl to be and move sl be:
    if user selected candle part is greater than user selected percent from entry
        move sl to user selected zero or entry
        set moved sl to be to True

if true and true
    if (low 2000 - avg entry 1000) / avg entry 1000 > user selected percent from entry
